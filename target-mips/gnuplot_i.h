  There is strictly no way to know if the command has been
  successfully executed or not.
  The command syntax is the same as printf.

  Examples:

  @code

  gnuplot_cmd(g, "plot %g * cos(%g * x)", 32.0, -3.0);

  Since the communication to the gnuplot process is run through
  a standard Unix pipe, it is only unidirectional. This means that
  it is not possible for this interface to query an error status
  back from gnuplot.
